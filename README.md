## Overview

The **Automated Monitoring System** is designed to track infrastructure performance in real-time, detect anomalies, and trigger alerts to prevent system failures. This project leverages Python, PowerShell, and cloud-based monitoring tools to ensure high availability and performance for critical systems.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks system metrics to provide up-to-date insights.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends notifications upon detecting anomalies or threshold breaches.
- **Scalability:** Easily adaptable to various infrastructure sizes and complexities.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design allows for seamless integration of additional monitoring components.
